/**
 * An env that permits an analysis pass to access information about symbols from the current pass,
 * recursively. Cycles are detected, and result in an {@link LazyBindingError} being thrown.
 *
 * <p>This is used primarily for resolving the supertype hierarchy in {@code HierarchyBinder}. The
 * supertype hierarchy forms a directed acyclic graph, and {@code HierarchyBinder} needs to process
 * classes in a topological sort order of that graph. Unfortuntately, we can't produce a suitable
 * sort order until the graph exists.
 *
 * @param <T> the interface type of the bound node {@link V}, shared by any underlying environments.
 * @param <V> a specific implementation of {@code T}. For example, during hierarchy binding {@code
 *     SourceHeaderBoundClass} nodes are being completed from the sources being compiled, and the
 *     analysis of a given symbol may require looking up {@code HeaderBoundClass} nodes that will
 *     either be backed by other {@code SourceHeaderBoundClass} nodes or {@code BytecodeBoundClass}
 *     nodes. So the phase uses an {@code LazyEnv<HeaderBoundClass, SourceHeaderBoundClass>}.
