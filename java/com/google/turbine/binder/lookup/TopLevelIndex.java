 * An index of canonical type names.

 * compiled. Also provides lookup scopes for individual packages.
 *
 * <p>Only top-level classes are stored. Nested type names can't usually be assumed to be canonical
 * (the qualifier may inherited the named type, rather than declaring it directly), so nested types
 * are resolved separately with appropriate handling of non-canonical names. For bytecode we may end
 * up storing desugared nested classes (e.g. {@code Map$Entry}), but we can't tell until the class
 * file has been read and we have access to the InnerClasses attribtue.
